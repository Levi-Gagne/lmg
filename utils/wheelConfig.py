Wheel File Utility Tool

This script provides utility functions for working with Python wheel (.whl) files and directories.

Features:
1. `unpack_wheel`: Unpacks a Python wheel file into a specified or default directory.
2. `zip_folder`: Zips the contents of a folder (including subfolders) into a .zip file.
3. `validate_wheel`: Validates if a file is a proper wheel (.whl) file.
4. `list_wheel_contents`: Lists the contents of a wheel file without extracting.
5. `repack_wheel`: Repackages a modified wheel directory into a new wheel file.
6. `inspect_wheel_metadata`: Inspects and displays metadata from the wheel.
7. `list_dependencies`: Lists dependencies from the wheel's METADATA file.

This script is designed to be used as an example tool for showcasing in a repository.

How to Run:
- Ensure you have Python installed along with the `zipfile` and `os` modules (both are standard).
- Copy the script into a `.py` file or run it directly in a Jupyter Notebook.
- Update the `wheel_path`, `folder_to_zip`, and `zip_file_name` variables with your paths.

Example Usage:
- Unpack a wheel file: `unpack_wheel('path_to_your_wheel_file.whl')`
- Zip a folder: `zip_folder('path_to_your_unpacked_directory', 'path_to_output_zip_file.zip')`
- Validate a wheel file: `validate_wheel('path_to_your_wheel_file.whl')`
- List wheel contents: `list_wheel_contents('path_to_your_wheel_file.whl')`
- Repack a wheel: `repack_wheel('path_to_directory', 'output_wheel_file.whl')`
- Inspect metadata: `inspect_wheel_metadata('path_to_your_wheel_file.whl')`
- List dependencies: `list_dependencies('path_to_your_wheel_file.whl')`
